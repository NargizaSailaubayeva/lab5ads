## Description
In this repository, I made laboratory 4 for Algorithms and Data Structures by creating class BST which meams Binary Search Tree and check it in main
+ A ***binary tree*** is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children referred to as the left child and the right child.
+ A ***binary search tree (BST)*** is a type of binary tree data structure that follows a specific ordering property. In a binary search tree, each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. Additionally, the values of the nodes in the left subtree of a given node are always less than the value of the node, and the values of the nodes in the right subtree are always greater.
